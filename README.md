# html_css-contest
Assignment to asses my HTML and CSS basic skills.
In this work, I will work on building a simple and beautiful website about a university students alumni, as one of the scenarios we must choose from in the assignment.
To build it, I will incorporate the basic skills I learned in HTML and CSS.
With HTML, I will use different elements and tags to structure the website.
CSS will help me to style and design the website in an appealing way.
I hope this is gonna be a beautiful start to building many more websites and applications. Happy learning!
